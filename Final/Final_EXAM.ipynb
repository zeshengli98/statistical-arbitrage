    "The definition of Pairs Trading is to take advantage of the mispricing between two or more assets by taking long and short portfolio, betting the related movement will converge back when mispricing situation happening. The principle is buy undervalued and sell overvalued. This is a very charming strategy that we can extend the idea in any market of interest. \n",
